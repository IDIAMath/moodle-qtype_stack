Repackaged the amd-folder. amd/src/jsxgraphcore.js has been updated to JSXGraph v1.4.5. It has
also been moved to amd/build, which the jsxgraph-creators recommend since the file is already
been minified.

Imported new files for 3D-radio question subtype. Changed graphing modules in threedradio.js so
